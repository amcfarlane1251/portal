## UFCOE Crumbs

This plugin generates more user/group-centric breadcrumbs.

* For user content, breadrcumbs start with the user's profile
* For group content, breadcrumbs start with a link to all groups, then the group profile
* Non-linked crumbs are removed

Instead of:

>Files (all files) > Joe User (Joe's files) > File Name (no link)

You get:

>Joe User (profile) > Files (Joe's files)

Instead of:

>Files (all files) > MyGroup (group files) > File Name (no link)

You get:

>Groups (all groups) > MyGroup (profile) > Files (group files)
